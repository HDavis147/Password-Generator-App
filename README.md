## Usage

Click "Generate Password" to begin the application. You will be asked to enter password length, and answer yes or no to the following criteria: lowercase characters, uppercase characters, numeric characters, and special characters. Once all prompts have been completed, the randomly generated password will be displayed in the center of the page.

The password generator can be accessed via GitHub Pages [HERE](https://hdavis147.github.io/Password-Generator-App/).
